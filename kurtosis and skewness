kurtosis : the degree of flatness and peakness in a region of curve.

types of curve 
medium : meto
low: platy -from normal its flatier
high :lepto - from normal it's peaker

skewness:degree of symmetry observed in a probabilitly distribution that derives  from symmmetrical normal distributuion . value in Q1 and Q3(quartile)
types of skewness: +ve -ve
+ve skewness : mean>median>mode
-ve skewness : mean<median<mode

The mean absolute error (MAE) is an average of the absolute errors. The MAE units are the same as the predicted target, which is useful for understanding whether the size of the error is of concern or not. The smaller the MAE the better the modelâ€™s performance.

Tip: MAE is robust to outliers. If you want a metric that is sensitive to outliers, try mean squared error (MSE).

RMSE is more sensitive to the examples with the largest difference This is because the error is squared before the average is reduced with the square root.

RMSE is more sensitive to ouliers: so the example with the largest error would skew the RMSE. MAE is less sensitive to outliers.
