Define regression?
Machine Learning Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It’s used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.  


define regression line?
it is used to fit the data with the  best hyperplane which goes through the points.
A regression line indicates a linear relationship between the dependent variables on the y-axis and the independent variables on the x-axis. The correlation is established by analyzing the data pattern formed by the variables.
If Y is the dependent variable and X is the independent variable, the Y on X regression line equation is represented as follows:
 ‘Y = a + bX + ɛ.’
Y is the dependent variable.
a is the Y-intercept.
b is the slope of the regression line.
X is the independent variable.
ɛ is the residual (error).
error=actual-pridicted

b = (N∑XY-(∑X)(∑Y) / (N∑X^2– (∑X)^2) ;

And,

a = (∑Y – b ∑X) / N

Where N is the total number of observations.
